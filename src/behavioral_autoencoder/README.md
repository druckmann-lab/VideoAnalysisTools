# README 
This package is organized as follows: 
- `networks.py` contains actual descriptions of network architectures which can be used as components of an autoencoder model. 
- `module.py` contains the logic which specifies which combination of network architectures correspond to what kind of models. 
- `metrics.py` contains custom build evaluation metrics. 
- `dataloading.py` contains code for the dataloaders with preprocessing. 
- `dataset.py` contains code to specify how datasets should be structured.
