# Behavioral video analysis autoencoder

This repository contains code to generalize autoencoder based analysis of behavioral video data, based on work previously described in Wang et al. 2023. This repository will be used to develop a standalone version of an autoencoder which would be more easily applicable to other datasets. 

## Roadmap: 
- [X] Standalone backbone of autoencoder model.
- [ ] Different architecture variants as may be useful for multi-session data recordings
- [ ] Data loading modules
- [ ] Preprocessing workflows
